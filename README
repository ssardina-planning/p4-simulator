INTRODUCTION
============

p4 (aka the "Python Path Planning Project") began as a Python 2.7
implementation of the Apparate path-planning simulator. It has been developed
and extended to support my Honours thesis (see docs/thesis) under the
guidance of Sebastian Sardina.

Use p4 to run search algorithms on maps presented in movingai format (see
www.movingai.com). Run with GUI, to observe their operation, without GUI to
obtain cost, steps and time-taken, or in auto mode to output csv files
of results for accumulated results from map problems in .scen format (also
from movingai).

p4 can be run from the command line or from within a wrapper script. In 
automatic mode, all info statements to the command line are supressed 
and output is delivered in csv format. 


USAGE
=====


 # python p4.py -h

Displays a help screen, with similar info to that shown here

 # python p4.py [<config_file>]

The config_file supplies settings as Python variables and includes information
such as what map and search algorithm to use. See config.py for expected format.
If config_file or file path not supplied, looks for default config.py.

 # python p4.py -m <MAP_FILE> -s <START> -g <GOAL> -a <AGENT_FILE> \
 	[-d <DEADLINE> -f <FREE_TIME> -e <euclid|manhattan> -r <SPEED> -nodiag -gui 
    -auto -dynamic -nonstrict -pre]
   where:
      MAP_FILE is a file in movingai format
      	if MAP_FILE is just a file name, it is assumed to be in ../maps/ sister folder
      AGENT_FILE is a file with prescribed API, saved to the AGENTS subfolder
      START is a tuple with start location in (col,row) format
      GOAL is a tuple with goal location in (col,row) format
      DEADLINE is time limit in seconds, defaults to None
      SPEED is a time delay in seconds between moves, defaults to 0
      TIMER defaults to clock
      FREE_TIME seconds to consider a step "for free"
      -nodiag - disallows diagonal moves 
      -gui - displays gui
      -auto - suppresses info messages and outputs result in csv format
      -dynamic - loads changes from script.py to occur during the search
      -nonstrict - permits traversal of impassable cells, albeit at infinite cost
      -pre - permits preprocessing by call to agent.preprocess()
      -batch <SCEN_FILE> <OUT_FILE> [reps] - reads problems from the scen file and outputs
        results to the OUT_FILE in csv format. Optionally takes integer in reps to specify
        number of repetitions across which test times are to be averaged.
        The <SCEN_FILE> MUST be in movingai scenario file format.  
        The map to be used must be in the same directory as the <SCEN_FILE> and its 
        name is the prefix up to .map included. For example, if the <SCEN_FILE> 
        is ../maps/bgmaps/AR0011SR.map.aopd.scen, then the map to be used will be file 
        ../maps/bgmaps/AR0011SR.map. The map names inside the .scen file will be ignored. 

Run a BATCH of scenarios described in AR0011SR.map.scen scenario file:

	# python p4.py -batch ../maps/bgmaps/AR0011SR.map.scen astar_batch.csv 3 -a agent_astar
      
Run the GUI with a random agent:

	# python p4.py -m AR0306SR.map  -s 218,110 -g 444,386 -a agent_random  -e euclid -d 20 -gui


An example of a command line call is (run this from inside src/)

   Run ASTAR in ../maps/testmap.map (around 0.26secs):
   
   # python p4.py -m testmap.map -s 155,123 -g 309,203 -a agent_astar  -e euclid -d 20
   or in Windows:
     python p4.py -m testmap.map -s (155,123) -g (309,203) -a agent_astar  -e euclid -d 20

   Run ASTAR in a harder problem with a solution of cost 510.41 and 440 steps ( (around 1.5secs):
   
   # python p4.py -m AR0306SR.map  -s 218,110 -g 444,386 -a agent_astar  -e euclid -d 20
    or in Windows:
     python p4.py -m AR0306SR.map  -s (218,110) -g (444,386) -a agent_astar  -e euclid -d 20
    
   Same but using JPS (around 0.4secs):

   # python p4.py -m AR0306SR.map -s 218,110 -g 444,386 -a agent_jps  -e euclid -d 20
    or in Windows:
     python p4.py -m AR0306SR.map -s (218,110) -g (444,386) -a agent_jps  -e euclid -d 20
    
Output is of the form:

       Total Cost : 510.416305603 | Total Steps : 440 | Time Remaining : 19.519 | Total Time : 0.48086

Total Cost: total cost of the solution plan; moves may be non-uniform and diagonal moves cost more than straight moves
Total Steps: number of steps that the plan takes
Time Remaining: time left to deadline given
Total Time: time taken (Total Time + Time Remaining = Deadline)

In -auto mode, output is in csv format: cost;steps;time_taken;time_remaining e.g:
    187.13708499;154;0.32759;19.672

INTERROGATE MODEL OUTSIDE SIMULATOR
===================================
In the src, directory, run the Python interpreter
>>>import p4_model as m
>>>l = m.LogicalMap("../maps/mixedcost3.map")   #or other existing map
>>># now you can interrogate the model, e.g...
>>>l.getCost((0,0))                         #note double brackets


BATCH & PROFILING (UNIX)
========================

a) Profile a run:

        /usr/bin/python -m cProfile p4.py -s time -m ../maps/AR0306SR.map  -s 218,110 -g 444,386 -a agent_astar -e euclid -d 20

        -s time : sorts by total time (without taking internal calls)
        -s comulative : sorts by cummulative time (taking all internal calls into account)

b) Run it 10 times and get the average time:

    run 10 /usr/bin/python  p4.py -m ../maps/AR0306SR.map  -s 218,110 -g 444,386 -a agent_jps_inv -e euclid -d 20 | grep Cost | awk '{total += $19} END {print total/10}'


Function run() should be defined (e.g., in .bashrc) as follows:

#function run
run() {
    number=$1
    shift
    for i in `seq $number`; do
      bash $@
    done
}

TECHNICAL INFO
==============

By default, algorithms are timed using time.clock(). Switch to time.time() by
resetting the global variable in p4_utils.py. p4_utils also controls colors
used to display returned lists. p4_utils.py provides settings and p4_model.py
presents an interface you can interrogate when implementing your own agents/
algorithms. For a detailed explanation of how to go about it, check the User
Guide and/or examine the supplied agent files.
